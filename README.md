# <Zaleski-02-Homework>
## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- The motivation behind this project was to create my own portfolio page, while given no code.  
- This project was done to help hone my skills on the skills Ive gathered over the two weeks and apply them to see if I have learned them or not.
- During my time working on this project, I have gained a new appreciation for those who are adept at building code from the ground up, its a lot more work than I would have thought.
- During the work, I realized just how hard code can be to read at the end of you work, because selectors can be all over the place.  So this taught me the importance of commenting and consolidating

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
